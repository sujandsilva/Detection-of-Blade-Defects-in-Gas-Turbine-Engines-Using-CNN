# Detection-of-Blade-Defects-in-Gas-Turbine-Engines-Using-CNN
This CNN model is created to detect various types of defects in gas turbine engine blades. It was trained based on a large number images with different classes of defects such as scratch, dirt, stain and damage. 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect defects in aero-engine images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model is designed to automatically identify and classify defects, enhancing maintenance efficiency and safety in the aerospace industry.

Objective: To build a CNN model for accurately detecting defects in images of aero-engine components.                                                                           
Dataset: [Images of aero-engine parts with labeled defects, used for training and testing the model.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wolfmedal/aero-engine-defect-new)
